Load function to read in Reading Universities TRACK output.
Should work for individual ensemble member files and also the
'combine' file.

Note: All files need to contain the DATES of the storms, not the
original timestep as output by TRACK.

Note: Any fields in addition to the full field vorticity, mslp
and 925 hPa max winds (e.g. 10m winds or precipitation) are not
currently stored. If you want these values you need to read in
the data file and include the variables in the 'extras' dictionary.

    Reads model tropical storm tracking output from Reading Universities TRACK

    10m wind information ex_cols=3 (lat, lon, 10m wind speed value).
